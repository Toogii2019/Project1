# Project1

Designing an application using at least two server-side APIs and a CSS framework other than Bootstrap as a group project. The interface must be interactive and at least one of the APIs must be a new third-party API. The application is then pitched to the targeted audience. 

Our group decided to create a trip advisor application. The user enters the initial travel point and the destination into the navigation bar, and the application will display a 5-day weather forecast of the destination, the travel distance by car, and a map with the starting and end locations pinned.

We did plan to include local events into the search results page using an API, however we were unable to get the API to work properly in time for the presentation. But instead, we were able to use Yelp's API to pull local restaurants in the destination town.

Some future developments we considered include expanding destinations to those outside of the USA, display local event/tourist recommendations, and calculating travel distance for more than just driving (flights, walking, etc).

Overall, deciding what we wanted our application to do was probably the most difficult part of this project. The planning, deciding API, and designing process came easier after we knew what we wanted to present to our users.
